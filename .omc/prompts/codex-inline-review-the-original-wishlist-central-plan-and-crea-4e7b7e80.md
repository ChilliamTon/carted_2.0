Review the original Wishlist Central plan and create a proper Phase 2 implementation sequence.

**ORIGINAL PHASE 2 GOALS:**
1. Web scraper (Puppeteer/Cheerio) with TDD
2. Price tracking system with history
3. Browser extension (Manifest V3) for URL sharing
4. Folders UI implementation
5. Real-time price change notifications

**CURRENT STATE:**
- ✅ Phase 1 MVP complete: Auth, Lists, Items, List Detail page
- ✅ Database schema includes price_history and availability_history tables
- ✅ All base CRUD operations working

**YOUR TASK:**
Create a logical, sequential implementation plan for Phase 2 that:
1. Orders features by dependency (what must be built first)
2. Identifies quick wins vs complex features
3. Suggests which to build first for maximum user value
4. Notes any missing infrastructure needed

**OUTPUT:**
Prioritized Phase 2 roadmap with:
- Feature order (1-5)
- Why that order makes sense (dependencies)
- Estimated complexity (Simple/Medium/Complex)
- Key technical decisions needed for each

Be concise and actionable.
