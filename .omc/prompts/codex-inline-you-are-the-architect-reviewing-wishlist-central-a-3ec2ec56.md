You are the architect reviewing Wishlist Central - a React wishlist management app.

**CURRENT STATE:**
- ✅ MVP built: Auth, Lists CRUD, Items CRUD hooks
- ✅ UI redesigned with modern commerce aesthetic
- ✅ Database schema with folders, lists, items, price_history, availability_history
- ✅ User just signed up successfully
- ⚠️ Missing: Item management UI, List detail page, Add item form

**YOUR TASK:**
Review the project and provide a prioritized implementation plan for the next features.

**Consider:**
1. What's the critical user flow? (sign up → create list → add items → view/manage)
2. What pages/components are missing for MVP completion?
3. Should we implement folders now or defer?
4. Route structure needed (currently no routing set up)
5. What's the most valuable feature to build next?

**OUTPUT:**
1. Critical missing pieces for functional MVP (in priority order)
2. Recommended routing structure
3. Next 3-5 features to implement (prioritized)
4. Any architectural concerns or improvements needed

Be concise and action-oriented. Focus on getting to a working prototype quickly.
