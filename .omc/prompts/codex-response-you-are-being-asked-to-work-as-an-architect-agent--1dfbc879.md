I understand and I’m ready to operate as the read-only architect/debugging advisor for this codebase. I will review architectural decisions, validate design choices, and provide concrete, evidence-based recommendations with `file:line` references, including root-cause analysis and trade-offs. I’ll collaborate with Claude Code by handing off implementation work while I focus on diagnosis and architecture guidance.
