You're architecting a web-first wishlist app with these requirements:
- Users save products from any shopping site via browser extension
- Organize items into lists and folders
- Track price changes and availability
- React frontend, web-compatible backend
- TDD approach for first 1000 lines

Recommend:
1. Backend: Supabase vs Firebase vs custom (with reasoning)
2. Database schema: key tables and relationships
3. Web scraping: best libraries and approach for diverse e-commerce sites
4. Deployment strategy

Keep response concise but technical. Focus on robustness and maintainability.
